# Commands

**Go to the directory where the key is**

cd C:\Users\Raphael\Desktop\College et Pro\sbu\BIO 312          (May not be needed due to perm conflicts, the key was moved to the root directory of the cmd)

**Connect to the instance**

ssh -i 312Key.pem ec2-user@54.235.102.113               (fine with disclosing my IP address here but normally try not to)
